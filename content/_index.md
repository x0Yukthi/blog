Hey, I'm Yukthi Chikkanna. Iâ€™m a graduate student passionate about coding, technology, and continuous learning. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on improving my programming skills, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub. Open-source is new to me, but Iâ€™m thrilled to be part of a community where I can both learn and give back.

Before starting my studies abroad, I worked for two years as a Java developer. That experience gave me a solid foundation in software development, teamwork, and problem-solving â€” skills Iâ€™m now building on as I take the next steps in my career.

I also have a few ideas Iâ€™m working on and hope to share more about as they take shape. This website is my space to document that journey â€” my progress, projects, and the lessons I discover along the way.

Thanks for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more as I grow.
