## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<img class="avatar" src="/images/myphoto.jpg" alt="my photo" style="width:190px;">

Curiosity and ambition have taken me from the bustling streets of Bangalore to the sun-soaked shores of California. Iâ€™m Yukthi, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

Before joining CSULB, I worked as a Java Developer at Wissen Technology in Bangalore, where I collaborated with Morgan Stanley on the Uncleared Margin Rule (UMR) team. There, I built scalable solutions to support financial risk management and regulatory compliance, gaining hands-on experience in designing high-impact systems.

Recently, Iâ€™ve started contributing to open-source projects, which has been an exciting new chapter in my journey. One highlight was enhancing the alfred-gcp-workflow, an Alfred tool for Google Cloud Platform, by adding a searchable feature for IAM service accounts, making resource access faster and more intuitive. These contributions have deepened my skills in collaborative development and broadened my exposure to cloud technologies.

Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems with creative solutions and continuously exploring new tools that push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. Beyond coding, I recharge by watching anime or playing badminton, pursuits that fuel both my curiosity and energy.
